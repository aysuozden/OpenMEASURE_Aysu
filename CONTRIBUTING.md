# Welcome

Thank you for taking your time to contribute to OpenMEASURE! This document will (hopefully) guide you on how to include your contribution in the `openmeasure` package.

## How to start

- If you don't have an objective yet, you can find something to do in the [issues](https://github.com/burn-research/OpenMEASURE/issues) page, and filter them by their labels.

- If you already have an objective in mind, please reach out to the maintainers to discuss the modification/addition. We will create a new issue so that we can track the progress.

## In practice

- Start by creating a fork of the repository, so that you can implement your modifications. Name the fork in a way that identifies the changes to be made. Try to keep the modification as small as possible, and try to aim for incremental changes. If you're not familiar with Git/GitHub, you can find some documentation [here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).

- Follow the git [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project#).

- Remember to document and annotate your code.

- Run the tests using `pytest`. 

- Once you pass all the tests, update the documentation in `docs/`.

- Create a pull request.

- The code will be merged, and we will release a new version of `openmeasure`.

## Tips

Before creating the fork, check your code in a python script. You can create a new class by inheriting on of the  `openmeasure` classes.
